GIT:
* can be done in a different order, but this is the order Shoha suggests

INITIAL SET UP
=======================
1. create local repo (git init)
2. create cloud repo (go to github.com and press green button)
3. create connection (git remote add origin <url>) *  origin is remote_name

UPDATING LIFECYCLE
=============================
1. git add . (. means all, could just upload one file, would put <filename>)
2. git commit -m "my message goes here" (first message is usually "first commit")
3. git push <remote_name> <branch> (git push origin master/main) * we want to use main

HELPFUL LIL COMMANDS
================
git remote -v (tells us all teh remotes this repo is connected to)
git status (git status of all files being tracked)

Questions:
==============
Does git get screwed up if you move a repo from one folder to another, or change the name of any parent folder in the repoâ€™s file path?
- not really(?)
- .git file is added to folder (hidden folder) when created
- as long as you move parent file with it

How to get git to commit to main instead of master?
